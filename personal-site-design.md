Q1.What is you site's primary purpose?

My sites primary purpose is to showcase and chronicle the growth of my web development skills over the next 17 weeks at EDA. It is also to tell the world a little bit about myself, exhibit my work and development to future employers and provide a way for the world to contact me.

Q2.Who is your target audience?

Initially my EDA coaches, my fellow cohort students and myself I suppose. Going forward, future employers and perhaps would-be EDA students.

Q3.How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like site visitors to have a simple, self- explanatory and informative experience with my site. Basically, visitors would have a 'what you see is what you get' experience. All the important starting point information is visible or is easily accessible from the home/index page. The site is visually uncluttered, clean, extremely functional, relevant and super easy to navigate around.

Q4.How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will follow the standard design and development process. Which has the following steps.

1. Analysis and information gathering- what is the purpose of my website, what are my websites goals, who is my target audience?
2. Planning - Deciding on the structure of my site and the technologies I will use to build it.
3. Design - Work out the layout of site using wireframe modelling, consider the visual style and type of experience I would like my website users to have.
4. Content - Work out what text content I need to have, do I need images, video, SEO etc.
5. Development - Actually building my website, right now I am only familiar with basic HTML and CSS but as the course and my skill set progresses perhaps I could consider Javascript, a database and hosting services.
6. Testing - Technical testing, is my code correct? Does my website features work and does my site have browser compatibilty?
7. Deployment - Releasing my site to the public, monitoring it, accessing any user feedback, fixing bugs ect.
8. Iterate - As time passes, maybe the purpose of my site changes, iterate steps 3-7 as changes are required.
