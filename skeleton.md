What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

Using a Chrome window resizer tool I resized the getskeleton.com webpage to a width that was less than 550 px. Immediately the browser window resized itself to the inputted measurements and reduced in size to roughly the size of a smartphone. As a result the getskeleton website responded to this change in size as it is a responsively deisgned website. By this I mean that all the content (text, images) and the layout of the webpage had resized itself to fit the new browser measurements. To view the resized getskeleton content all I had to do was slide the side scroll bar downwards to view it. As the website responded responsively it meant I did not have to scroll right to left along the bottom of the page to view the page content as it was all visable just by scrolling up and down and resized itself to fit perfectly into the  browser. 

Responsive design is the practise of building a webiste to work on every device and screen size no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. It solves the problem of making the same code work across multiple screen resolutions. There are three main components that come together to form responsive design; Fluid Grids, Fluid Images and Media Queries.
